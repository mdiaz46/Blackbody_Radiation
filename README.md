# Blackbody_Radiation
This is the Planck function for radiation, first derived by Max Planck in the year 1900. The Planck function thus is the spectrum produced by a perfect emitter (a body that can emit photons at all fre- quencies); since a perfect emitter is also a perfect absorber, we often refer to light that has a Planck spectrum as blackbody radiation.
